# Health Advice Group

A simple app which gives you health advice based on the current weather in your location. Also displays a nice visual representation of the air quality in your area üòÅ

# Development

Please fork this repository into your account, and clone the forked version onto your machine.

To make development easier (at least for myself) I am using Docker and Docker Compose to automatically run both the frontend and the backend components.
If you are unfamiliar with how to use these tools please read their documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

On the other hand if you already know how to use Docker and Docker Compose then just run 
```sh
docker-compose up --build --watch
```
