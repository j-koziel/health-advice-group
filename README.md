# Health Advice Group

A simple app which gives you health advice based on the current weather in your location. Also displays a nice visual representation of the air quality in your area üòÅ

# Development

First clone this repo.

Now, there are two ways you can run this app. If you have docker installed just run `docker-compose up --build --watch`
This will run both the API and the React App. The `--watch` flag means that changes on your machine will sync with what is in the container
